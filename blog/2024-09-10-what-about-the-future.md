Okay so, in the next year or so I will do the things presented on the following :

- [Let's Make a Voxel Engine](https://sites.google.com/site/letsmakeavoxelengine/home)
- some of [build-your-own-x](https://github.com/codecrafters-io/build-your-own-x)
- learn piano or something
- make a doc about tmux and learn it at the same time
- make a doc about neovim and learn it the same time
- End "Turing complete" game, make some notes about it (I'm halfway through)

Maybe(s) :

- Make a specific osint engine (in rust or zig idk)
