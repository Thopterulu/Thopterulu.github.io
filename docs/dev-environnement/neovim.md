I started to use Neovim, because apparently it's superior for programming (I'm jealous of people that know every shortcuts / motions).

## modes

there is 2 modes `normal` and `insert`, by default we use normal, we switch to the insert with the letter `i`.

### normal mode

In normal mode you can navigate in the code with the letters  `h`, `j`, `k`, `l`. Tester en avec un clavier azerty.

## [Word motions](https://learnbyexample.github.io/vim_reference/Normal-mode.html#word-motions)

Definitions from [:h word](https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#word) and [:h WORD](https://vimhelp.org/motion.txt.html#WORD) are quoted below to explain the difference between **word** and **WORD**.

> word A word consists of a sequence of letters, digits and underscores, or a sequence of other non-blank characters, separated with white space (spaces, tabs, <EOL>). This can be changed with the iskeyword option. An empty line is also considered to be a word.
> 

> WORD A WORD consists of a sequence of non-blank characters, separated with white space. An empty line is also considered to be a WORD.
