# Intro

Hey hey people, Thopterulu here.

## The goal is to share / remember / Learn about stuff

It's an interesting journey about stuff that I wanted to learn at school, but I didn't because I went and did other things.

the topics in this doc (you can find them on the left as categories) are mainly the following ones:

- how to setup a good working environnement for devs
- Simple commands and stuff to simplify your coding journey
- A bunch of electronic, computer and Turing stuff
- Little tips to make website quickly
- Usefull ressources to know (if they really matters)

## Legitimity and stuff

You can always question what your reading, I'm certainly not a prophet nor a 10x dev nor an brilliant scientific. Just someone who try to learn new things and loves to share (also to write some down to remember it).


## Language

I choosed to write in English but as they say in the cringe british video "English is my city". So I deeply apologies in advance for all spellings mistakes and grammaticals errors. I'm writing this in vim and I still haven't learn about installing grammar checking plugins, so yeah :p
