### [Debian GNU/Linux](https://www.debian.org/)

> The Debian Project is an association of individuals who have made common cause to create a free operating system. This operating system is called Debian. Debian systems currently use the Linux kernel. Linux is a completely free piece of software started by Linus Torvalds and supported by thousands of programmers worldwide. Of course, the thing that people want is application software: programs to help them get what they want to do done, from editing documents to running a business to playing games to writing more software. Debian comes with over 50,000 packages (precompiled software that is bundled up in a nice format for easy installation on your machine) - all of it free. It's a bit like a tower. At the base is the kernel. On top of that are all the basic tools. Next is all the software that you run on the computer. At the top of the tower is Debian -- carefully organizing and fitting everything so it all works together.

LINUX BASICS

[https://github.com/Forty-Bot/linux-checklist](https://github.com/Forty-Bot/linux-checklist)

## Notes

**If a command errors or fails, try it again with `sudo` (or `sudo !!` to save typing)**

**Google anything and everything. If you don't know or understand something, google it**

When you see the syntax `$word`, do not type it verbatim, but instead substitute the appropriate word (usually referenced in a previous command).

When the order of steps does not matter, bullet points have been used instead of ordinals.

To edit files, run `gedit`, a graphical editor akin to notepad; `nano`, a simple command-line editor; or `vim`, a powerful  but less intuitive command-line editor. Note that vim may need to be installed with `apt-get install vim`.

## Checklist

1. Read the readme
    
    Note down which ports/users are allowed.
    
2. **Do Forensics Questions**
    
    You may destroy the requisite information if you work on the checklist!
    
3. Secure root
    
    set `PermitRootLogin no` in `/etc/ssh/sshd_config`
    
4. Secure Users
    1. Disable the guest user.
        
        Go to `/etc/lightdm/lightdm.conf` and add the line
        
        `allow-guest=false`
        
        Then restart your session with `sudo restart lightdm`. This will log you out, so make sure you are not executing anything important.
        
    2. Open up `/etc/passwd` and check which users
        - Are uid 0
        - Can login
        - Are allowed in the readme
    3. Delete unauthorized users:
        
        `sudo userdel -r $user`
        
        `sudo groupdel $user`
        
    4. Check `/etc/sudoers.d` and make sure only members of group sudo can sudo.
    5. Check `/etc/group` and remove non-admins from sudo and admin groups.
    6. Check user directories.
        1. cd `/home`
        2. `sudo ls -Ra *`
        3. Look in any directories which show up for media files/tools and/or "hacking tools."
    7. Enforce Password Requirements.
        1. Add or change password expiration requirements to `/etc/login.defs`.
            
            ```
            PASS_MIN_DAYS 7
            PASS_MAX_DAYS 90
            PASS_WARN_AGE 14
            
            ```
            
        2. Add a minimum password length, password history, and add complexity requirements.
            1. Open `/etc/pam.d/common-password` with sudo.
            2. Add `minlen=8` to the end of the line that has `pam_unix.so` in it.
            3. Add `remember=5` to the end of the line that has `pam_unix.so` in it.
            4. Locate the line that has [pam.cracklib.so](http://pam.cracklib.so/) in it. If you cannot find that line, install cracklib with `sudo apt-get install libpam-cracklib`.
            5. Add `ucredit=-1 lcredit=-1 dcredit=-1 ocredit=-` to the end of that line.
        3. Implement an account lockout policy.
            1. Open `/etc/pam.d/common-auth`.
            2. Add `deny=5 unlock_time=1800` to the end of the line with `pam_tally2.so` in it.
        4. Change all passwords to satisfy these requirements.
            
            `chpasswd` is very useful for this purpose.
            
5. Enable automatic updates
    
    In the GUI set Update Manager->Settings->Updates->Check for updates:->Daily.
    
6. Secure ports
    1. `sudo ss -ln`
    2. If a port has `127.0.0.1:$port` in its line, that means it's connected to loopback and isn't exposed. Otherwise, there should only be ports which are specified in the readme open (but there probably will be tons more).
    3. For each open port which should be closed:
        1. `sudo lsof -i :$port`
        2. Copy the program which is listening on the port.
        `whereis $program`
        3. Copy where the program is (if there is more than one location, just copy the first one).
        `dpkg -S $location`
        4. This shows which package provides the file (If there is no package, that means you can probably delete it with `rm $location; killall -9 $program`).
        `sudo apt-get purge $package`
        5. Check to make sure you aren't accidentally removing critical packages before hitting "y".
        6. `sudo ss -l` to make sure the port actually closed.
7. Secure network
    1. Enable the firewall
        
        `sudo ufw enable`
        
    2. Enable syn cookie protection
        
        `sysctl -n net.ipv4.tcp_syncookies`
        
    3. Disable IPv6 (Potentially harmful)
        
        `echo "net.ipv6.conf.all.disable_ipv6 = 1" | sudo tee -a /etc/sysctl.conf`
        
    4. Disable IP Forwarding
        
        `echo 0 | sudo tee /proc/sys/net/ipv4/ip_forward`
        
    5. Prevent IP Spoofing
        
        `echo "nospoof on" | sudo tee -a /etc/host.conf`
        
8. Install Updates
    
    Start this before half-way.
    
    - Do general updates.
        1. `sudo apt-get update`.
        2. `sudo apt-get upgrade`.
    - Update services specified in readme.
        1. Google to find what the latest stable version is.
        2. Google "ubuntu install service version".
        3. Follow the instructions.
    - Ensure that you have points for upgrading the kernel, each service specified in the readme, and bash if it is [vulnerable to shellshock](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shellshock_%28software_bug%29).
9. Configure services
    1. Check service configuration files for required services.
    Usually a wrong setting in a config file for sql, apache, etc. will be a point.
    2. Ensure all services are legitimate.
        
        `service --status-all`
        
10. Check the installed packages for "hacking tools," such as password crackers.
11. Run other (more comprehensive) checklists. This is checklist designed to get most of the common points, but it may not catch everything.

## Tips

- Netcat is installed by default in ubuntu. You will most likely not get points for removing this version.
- Some services (such as `ssh`) may be required even if they are not mentioned in the readme. Others may be points even if they are explicitly mentioned in the readme

nslookup command because it’s another command line tool that is usually available. This tool looks up IP addresses assigned to website domain names.

tracert tool, which sends packets to each router along the path between your computer and the destination you  want your traffic to reach.

# [AppArmor](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/apparmor.html#apparmor)

AppArmor is an effective and easy-to-use Linux application security
system. AppArmor proactively protects the operating system and
applications from external or internal threats, even zero-day attacks,
by enforcing good behavior and preventing even unknown application flaws
from being exploited.

AppArmor security policies completely define what system resources
individual applications can access, and with what privileges. Several
default policies are included with AppArmor, and using a combination of
advanced static analysis and learning-based tools, AppArmor policies for
even very complex applications can be deployed successfully in a matter
of hours.

## [Check if AppArmor is installed](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/apparmor.html#check-if-apparmor-is-installed)

AppArmor and it's profiles should already be enabled and running on Parrot OS. To check if AppArmor is active do:

```
sudo aa-status --enabled; echo $?

```

The output should return 0. Alternatively run the following command to see the loaded AppArmor profiles:

```
sudo aa-status

```

![https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/images/apparmor/0.png](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/images/apparmor/0.png)

If for any reason AppArmor is not pre-installed, continue reading below.

## [Install AppArmor](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/apparmor.html#install-apparmor)

```
sudo apt install apparmor apparmor-utils auditd

```

**apparmor** = main package **apparmor-utils** = utilities for controlling apparmor profiles **auditd** = automatic profile generation tools

To enable AppArmor run the followng commands:

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/default/grub.d

```

```
echo 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT apparmor=1 security=apparmor"' | sudo tee /etc/default/grub.d/apparmor.cfg

```

```
sudo update-grub

```

```
sudo reboot

```

Then run the following command to inspect the current state:

```
sudo aa-status

```

This will list all loaded AppArmor profiles for applications,
processes and detail their status (enforced, complain, unconfined).

For example, to check what is enforce mode, run the following command:

```
ps auxZ | grep -v '^unconfined'

```

To install profile, run the following command:

```
sudo apt install apparmor-profiles apparmor-profiles-extra

```

AppArmor profiles live in `/etc/apparmor.d/`.
You can use apparmor_parser(8) to insert them into the kernel. This is
done automatically when installing packages that drop policy in `/etc/apparmor.d/`.

For example, to set all "extra" profiles (provided in the
apparmor-profiles package) to complain mode (except deny rules that are
silently enforced, security policy is not enforced and access violations
are logged), do the following:

```
cd /usr/share/doc/apparmor-profiles/extras

```

```
cp -i *.* /etc/apparmor.d/

```

```
for f in *.*;
    do aa-complain /etc/apparmor.d/$f;
done

```

To set these profiles to **enforce mode**, use `aa-enforce` instead of `aa-complain`.
Beware though: many of these profiles are not up-to-date and will break
functionality in enforce mode (and possibly even in complain mode);
enforce them only if you're ready to improve them upstream.

## [Disable AppArmor](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/apparmor.html#disable-apparmor)

First, you can disable individual profiles with `aa-disable`.
But if you want to *entirely* disable AppArmor on your system, run:

```
sudo mkdir -p /etc/default/grub.d

```

```
echo 'GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT="$GRUB_CMDLINE_LINUX_DEFAULT apparmor=0"' | sudo tee /etc/default/grub.d/apparmor.cfg

```

```
sudo update-grub

```

```
sudo reboot

```

## [Debug AppArmor](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/apparmor.html#debug-apparmor)

The `aa-notify` command, from the *apparmor-notify* package, is able to provide a desktop notification whenever a program causes a DENIED message in `/var/log/kern.log`. Grant yourself read permissions for `/var/log/kern.log` by joining the adm group:

```
sudo adduser "$USER" adm

```

Then `aa-notify` should automatically start the next time you login (using `/etc/xdg/autostart/apparmor-notify.desktop`). If it doesn't, start it manually:

```
aa-notify -p

```

If you use **auditd**, you should start `aa-notify` in this way:

```
sudo aa-notify -p -f /var/log/audit/audit.log

```

### [Diagnose if a bug might have been caused by AppArmor](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/apparmor.html#diagnose-if-a-bug-might-have-been-caused-by-apparmor)

The apparmor-utils package provides many useful commands to debug AppArmor. Find out if AppArmor is enabled through `cat` command:

```
cat /sys/module/apparmor/parameters/enabled

```

This will return Y if true.

### [Find out which profiles are enabled](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/apparmor.html#find-out-which-profiles-are-enabled)

```
sudo aa-status

```

The command above will list all loaded AppArmor profiles for
applications and processes and detail their status (enforced, complain,
unconfined).
And,

```
ps auxZ | grep -v '^unconfined'

```

will list running executables which are currently confined by an
AppArmor profile. Sometimes, it's useful to disable a profile and to
test again if the bug persists:

```
sudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/$profile

```

e.g. `sudo aa-disable /etc/apparmor.d/usr.bin.pidgin`.

You can re-enable the profile in this way:

```
sudo aa-enforce /etc/apparmor.d/$profile

```

### [Verify the logs](https://www.parrotsec.org/docs/apparmor.html#verify-the-logs)

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/syslog | grep 'DENIED'

```

or (if **auditd** is installed):

```
sudo tail -f /var/log/auditd/auditd.log | grep 'DENIED'

```

The "DENIED" lines should provide more information on what concrete
process or access to the file system has been denied. Output a list of
processes with tcp or udp ports that do not have AppArmor profiles
loaded:

```
sudo aa-unconfined

```

also possible with the `--paranoid` parameter.

Profiles in complain mode will send ALLOWED lines in the logs for
entries that would normally be DENIED in enforce mode. You can use this
to tweak configurations before turning them on in enforce mode.
